Description:
As a Data Analytics Intern, I worked over the course of 8 weeks to build a machine-learning model from the ground up. 
Starting with data collection and integration using SQL in Snowflake. The data preprocessing and cleaning using SQL and Python. Lastly creating a machine-learning model that predicted the likelihood that an account would close

Responsibilities:
- Utilized Python for data analysis, extracting valuable insights to inform strategic decisions
- Improved customer retention through data preparation in Snowflake, predictive analysis in Python, and two multipage Power BI apps
- Presented companies first implemented Machine Learning project to Executive Leadership and Marketing team

- Not Available: Due to the security protocols mandated by the, the work is unable to be displayed. However, below are descriptions of the key deliverables accomplished during my internship
- Presentation: Delivered a comprehensive presentation highlighting the project during my internship. This included showcasing the developed model, and its outputs and provided an introductory overview of Machine Learning, particularly significant as it marked the company's first a machine learning model in production.
- SQL Code: Leveraged Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing platform, to proficiently craft SQL solutions. Tasks included creating transient tables, employing sub-queries, executing joins, utilizing aggregation functions, implementing conditional logic, and more.
- Python Code: Utilized Python in conjunction with Snowflake connections to prepare data tables for analysis. Conducted thorough testing of various machine learning models, resulting in the successful training and deployment of a machine learning algorithm.
- Power BI Dashboard - ML Results: Connected the results from the machine learning algorithm to a multipage dashboard that includes click-throughs and data visualizations for end users
- Power BI Dashboard - Data Analytics: The company was switching from DOMO to Power BI and helped recreate multipage dashboards so departments could continue to use the descriptive statistics in their day-to-day tasks
